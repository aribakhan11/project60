        <h3>
            My hobby is reading books and coding. My school is located in chandigrarh. I have been known for my creative writing skills and english.In 5Th class I even won an award for the winner in the creative writing.I even have a younger sister.She is very naughty and adventurous.In my family my father is the most hilarious one of us all.My mother helps me in my studies and take care for us. Now in this pandemic We are not going to school and each one of us is getting bored every single day.Some people and children have started to keep them busy at home while not going outsite while some haven't. I really want to become an IAS officer and also to get that position I need to work hard,Which I am willing to. I hope you all have a great time.
